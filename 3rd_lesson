const wrap = document.querySelector("#wrapper");


# This wil grab the element with the id or "wrapper" and it is storing it in the variable "wrap"


const wmf = document.querySelector("#book-list li:nth-child(2) .name");

# This will grab a specific element in a specific /li tag


var books = document.querySelectorAll("#book-list li .name");

# The querySelectorAll can grab all the elements specified.

# You can use for loops to cycle through a collection of elements that have been grabbed like in the last lesson
